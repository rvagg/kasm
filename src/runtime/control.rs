//! WebAssembly label stack for control flow
//!
//! Implements the label stack as described in the WebAssembly specification.
//! See: <https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#labels>
//!
//! From the spec:
//! > "Labels carry an arity n and their associated branch target, which is expressed
//! > syntactically as an instruction sequence"
//!
//! The label stack tracks active control constructs (blocks, loops) and enables
//! structured control flow through branch instructions.
